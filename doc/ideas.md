# Game concepts & mechanics ideas

**General**

 - Dynamic world - moons slowly orbiting a central planet
 - Fog of war - line of sight or range-based
   - Line of sight: "I can hide behind moons"
 - Minimap or directional combat indicators
 - AI picks random strategy/personality
 - AI difficulty from resource boost or suboptimal play
 - ~200 max units in-game

**Units, movement & combat**

 - Move commands only
   - Combat via auto-attacks
 - Commands are "anchored" to a dynamic object (follow) or a static location (hold)
 - Units fly a holding pattern when near their destination
 - Groups fly to offset location based on their starting point & to spread out
 - Swarming/flocking unit behaviour
 - Units have limited physics attached

**Economy**

 - Economy slider - no eco micro
   - Invest or Spend, Invest means more to spend later
 - Resource collection based on map control
   - Control points
   - Creeps
 - Resource collection based on investment only

**Theme**

 - Loose theme - space war across moons
 - Art styles
   - Neon
   - Paper
   - CRT
   - Comic book
   - Sketchbook
 - "You're here for the gameplay"
