# Development notes

## Bitmap fonts

 - Find a good ttf font e.g. Upheaval
 - Use [bmfont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) (under Wine in Linux)
 - Select a subset of the characters (first few rows)
 - In "Export Options", use a 32-bit texture & select the preset "Black text with alpha"
 - Change file format to "xml" and textures to "png"
 - Save & rename ".fnt" => ".xml"
